Science notes- exploration 2

First thoughts â€“ 2015-21-08

How and why does the daily path of the sun across the sky change for different locations on earth?

1. Why is position at sunrise and set different between north pole and equator?
1. In december, due to tilt, sun is below the equator in the sky and the north pole is above
2.  How and why would the difference be at rise and set in june?
1. In june, the sun is offset 23.5 degrees from the equator as opposed to 66.5 degrees from north pole
3. why is the position of the sun at transit different between those 2 places in december?
1. Same as original; the sin is closer to the equator than the north pole

and other stuff

23.5 degrees north is tropic of cancer
23.5 degrees south is tropic of capricorn
